        Hello! My name is Isaac Miller. I am in my Sophomore year at KU. I have worked on several projects at KU through the labs, including a program that can find the exit to a maze
        using recursion and a program that can simulate a DMV! I also have been working as an IT intern at Employers since the start of the summer! A couple of fun facts about myself 
        is that I love chili (the food) and that also love watching sports, including football. You can contact me with my school email at isaac.miller@ku.edu. Have a good day!
